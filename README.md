<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<strong>Burn.fish</strong> is a simple tool to burn ethers the right way, using a self-destructed contract that sends ethers to itself.

There are many reasons to burn your coins (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-burn-cryptocurrency.asp">Proof of Burn</a>),
yet the most common way to burn coins is by sending to a <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000">'dead' wallet</a>(some have over billion dollars worth of tokens), which is not the right way...

Here's why:
* There is no way to verify the 'dead' wallet private key was actually destroyed
* A 'dead' wallet is like a super valuable and secure* safe in Times Square, where everyone is trying to break into
* Why worry about the small probability of a dead wallet becoming undead

By using a self-destructed contract (Burn.Fish), the ETH vanishes completely where the address of the contract no longer has any balance or code!!
